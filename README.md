# TypeScript katas

![](https://www.codewars.com/users/besterboris/badges/micro)

This repo contains my solutions for some TypeScript katas submitted in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

## Run tests

```shell
npm ci
npm test
```

## Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) stylecheck/linting

```shell
npm ci
npm run lint
```

## Fix style automatically

```shell
npm run stylefix
```

### pre-commit hooks

Pro-tip: Use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for this project.

```shell
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Please do not re-submit my solutions.
